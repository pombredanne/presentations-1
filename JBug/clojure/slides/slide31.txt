Sequences
---------
Sequence = iterator in other languages
Three basic operations
    first
        returns the first item in the collection/sequence
    rest
        returns (possibly empty) sequence of the items after the first item
    next
        returns a sequence of items after the first item
        nil instead of empty sequence
All collections are sequences
