Parallel programming
--------------------
pmap/pcalls/pvalues
    pmap
        parallel map
        it isn't always better to parallelize things!
        pmap is not always faster than map
    pcalls
        (pcalls func1 func2 func3 ...)
        returns lazy sequence containing return values of called functions
        (pcalls (fn [] (compute 10)) (fn [] (compute 20)) (fn [] (compute -1)))
    pvalues
        returns a lazy sequence of the values of the exprs, which are evaluated in parallel
        (def results (pvalues (compute 10) (compute 20) (compute 30)))
