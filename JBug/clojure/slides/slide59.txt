Web apps (Clojure Ring philosophy)
----------------------------------
Clojure Ring
    Pure function to transform request->response
    Basically Map -> Map
    Well not that easy in real apps :)
Four components of web app:
    Handler
    Request
    Response
    Middleware
Request
    A map with keys:
    :server-port, :uri, :query-string, :headers, :request-method, :body (POST)
Response
    A map with keys:
    :status, :headers, :body
Middleware
    Session processing
    Params
    Content type
    HTTP code
    etc.
