Java <--> Clojure communication
-------------------------------
Clojure can create an instance of a Java class and access its attributes and methods
    JSR-292 support
Programs are compiled into JVM bytecode
    On the fly
        The best of "scripted" and "compiled" worlds :-)
    With support for dynamic typing 
        Not an easy task (before invokedynamic)
