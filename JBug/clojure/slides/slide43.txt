Future and promise
------------------
promise
    can be used to implement a dataflow model
    usually used together with a "future" object
    three functions
        promise
            creates "promise" objects
        deliver value
            usually called from a "future" thread
            only the first value is really set
        deref value
            might wait for the "future" thread to finish
            deref == @
            !!! can possibly lead to deadlock !!!
