Functions
---------
Functions have similar properties as other values
    It's possible to create new functions in runtime
    Function could be passed to other function as a parameter
    Function could be returned by other function as its return value
    Function could be stored in list, vector, map etc.
    Name could be bind to a function
        but it's not needed in all cases
        anonymous functions
        used extensivelly not only in Clojure
