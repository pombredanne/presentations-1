Atoms
-----
synchronous state change
    change of value is "atomic"
    other threads can use new value immediatelly
    BUT other threads could "see" intermediate values
        -> difference from Refs
Constructor
    (def name (atom value))
Get value
    (deref name)
    @name
Change value
    reset!
        sets new value
    swap!
        calls function on the old value
Other
    compare-and-set!
        similar to test-and-set atomic oop
