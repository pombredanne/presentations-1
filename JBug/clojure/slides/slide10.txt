Basic Clojure features
----------------------
Lambda expressions
Closures
Explicit tail recursion
Clojure is lazy
    ie it is like many humans (incl. /me)
    Performs required work only when forced/asked
    Lazy sequences
        range function is a good example
    Some work (computation) does not have to be performed ASAP
        Let's start it in a background thread!
