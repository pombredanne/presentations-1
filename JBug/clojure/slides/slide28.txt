Vectors
    used extensivelly in Clojure
    Based on RRB-Trees, Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees
    usually takes less memory than lists
        <=32 items -> simple array
        <=1024 items -> tree with height=2
            root=32 references to 32-item vectors
        <= 32768 items -> tree with height=3
            and so on...
Examples
    [1 2 3 4]
    [ [1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]]
